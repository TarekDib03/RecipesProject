  	     <p>Mutabbal is a Levant dish found through out Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Egypt. It is a delicious and healthy dish, particulary for vegetarian. One could eat Mutabbal by dipping it in Pita bread or any other kind of bread, or one could eat it with a spoon. Many have Mutabbal as a starter, however, it could be a full meal, especially if accompanied by salad and pickles on the side. Mutabbal is made of roasted, peeled and mashed eggplant, blended with tahini, mashed garlic, salt and lemon juice. It is normally served with a dressing of extra virgin olive oil. In addition, many people may also eat it with mint, or may spray it with chopped parsely and sprinkle it with pomegranate seeds.</p>

                <h3>Method</h3>
  	                 <ol>
                        <li> Roast the eggplant until the skin appears almost burnt and the eggplant begins to collapse
  		                </li>
  		                <li> While the eggplant is cooking, smash the garlic and mix it with tahini     sauce, salt and lemon juice. The quantities used depend on how many eggplants one is cooking, in addition how much of tahini, garlic and lemon one may like. So always taste, and if you think you may like more lemon, salt, garlic or tahini, go ahead and add some. Learning how to cook a new dish is an experiment at the beginning and a great experience when you get the passion and love. 
  		                </li>
  		                <li> Now, it is the time to add the mix in Step 2 to the cooked eggplant in Step 1, and mix all together. Smash the eggplant until it is a dip. 
  		                </li>
  		                <li>And the best ingredients in cooking Mutabbal and any dish for that matter are <em><b>love</b></em> and <em><b>passion.</b></em>
  		                </li>
  		                <li> Always remember to enjoy the experience of cooking. It is an adventurous journey with plenty of ups and downs :)

                         <li>Add the potatoes to the meat. And cook until the meat and the potatoes are fully cooked. Now sprinkle the garam masala and a few whole green chilies (for flavour and not heat) and cover and cook for another 3-5 minutes.

            <p>Spinach rice is a Mediterranean dish served in many parts of the middle east, particularly Lebanon and Palestine, Europe, particularly in Greece and Armenia. Yet it a simple dish to make, it is both healthy and delicious. It is a great dish for those who are vegetarian. It is usually served as an appetizer, however, if served with salad, it could be considered a full meal. Personally, I like to have it with green salad and salmon.</p>

  	                 <ol>
                         <li>Wash the spinach and let it drain for about five minutes or so</li>
                         <li>In a pot, heat up the olive oil (watch out not to burn the oil). Then add the chopped garlic and the the chopped spinach. Cook for about 5-10 minutes until the spinach is soaked. Then squeeze some lemon, however, you may wait until the spinach rice is done. It is your option!
                         </li>
                         <li>Add the rice to spinach, then add water and salt to taste. For every cup of rice, I usually add 3 cups of water. Cook until boil, then put heat to low, and cover the pot. Cook until all the water is soaked by the rice.
