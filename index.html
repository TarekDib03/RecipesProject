      <h2>Mutabbal</h2>
  	<img src="mutabbal.jpg" alt="Mutabbal">
  	<p>Mutabbal is a Levant dish found through out Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Jordan and Egypt. It is a delicious and healthy dish, particulary for vegetarian. One could eat Mutabbal by dipping it in Pita bread or any other kind of bread, or one could eat it with a spoon. Many have Mutabbal as a starter, however, it could be a full meal, especially if accompanied by salad and pickles on the side. Mutabbal is made of roasted, peeled and mashed eggplant, blended with tahini, mashed garlic, salt and lemon juice. It is normally served with a dressing of extra virgin olive oil. In addition, many people may also eat it with mint, or may spray it with chopped parsely.</p>
  	<h3>Recipes</h3>
  	<ol>
  		<li> Roast the eggplant until the skin appears almost burnt and the eggplant begins to collapse</li>
  		<li> While the eggplant is cooking, smash the garlic and mix it with tahini sauce, salt and lemon juice. The quantities used depend on how many eggplants one is cooking, in addition how much of tahini, garlic and lemon one may like. So always taste, and if you think you may like more lemon, salt, garlic or tahini, go ahead and add some. Learning how to cook a new dish is an experiment at the beginning and a great experience when you get the passion and love. </li>
  		<li> Now, it is the time to add the mix in Step 2 to the cooked eggplant in Step 1, and mix all together. Smash the eggplant until it is a dip. </li>
  		<li> And the best ingredients in cooking Mutabbal and any dish for that matter are <em><b>love</b></em> and <em><b>passion</b></em> :) </li>
  		<li> Always remember to enjoy the experience of cooking. It is an adventurous journey with plenty of ups and downs :) </li>
